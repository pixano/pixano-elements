## Components overview

The Pixano Elements are divided into `packages`. Each package can be installed independantly from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) using the following command:

```
npm install @pixano/graphics-2d
```

Each package can contain multiple web components which are regrouped by affinity.

## Requirements

Pixano requires WebGL to be activated in your browser. If you see the following error in you console `WebGL unsupported in this browser`, please [activate](https://superuser.com/questions/836832/how-can-i-enable-webgl-in-my-browser) it.

For development, you will only need Node.js installed in your environement.

- #### Node installation on Windows

  Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

- #### Node installation on Ubuntu

  You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.
    ```bash
    sudo apt install nodejs
    sudo apt install npm
    ```
  Or install it with snap: `sudo snap install node`

- #### Other Operating Systems
  You can find more information about the installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

```bash
node --version
# v10.19.0

npm --version
# 6.10.0
```
#### note about npm version
If you need to install a specific version of npm, you can use the following command line:
```bash
npm install -g npm@6.10.0
```
> If you encounter "EACCES: permission denied" error message, please follow [this guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally).


## Build and run the overall demo
An online serverless demo is available on our dedicated [website](https://pixano.github.io/demo/demo).

If you want to build the latests version, it's easy:
```
git clone https://github.com/pixano/pixano-elements.git
cd pixano-elements
npm run deps
npm run build
npx serve demo
```

## Documentation

ðŸ“š Check out the [TypeDoc](https://pixano.github.io/docs/docs) documentation. Each package's usage and API is also documented:

- [graphics-2d](https://github.com/pixano/pixano-elements/blob/master/packages/graphics-2d)
- [graphics-3d](https://github.com/pixano/pixano-elements/blob/master/packages/graphics-2d)


You can also try the demos on our [website](http://pixano.cea.fr/bounding-box/).


## How to contribute ?

### Getting started

To create a new component, check our [tutorial](./documentation/how_to_create_a_new_component.md).

Please follow our [coding guidelines](./documentation/coding_guidelines.md) for your contributions.

#### About the contribution process

The contribution process follows this well-known diagram :

![diagram-pull-request.png](documentation/diagram-pull-request.png)

### First time:
#### Fork and clone

1. Fork this project

	*Click on the Fork button*
	
2. Clone the fork on your local machine
```bash
	git clone git@github.com:$YOURLOGIN/pixano-elements.git
	# OR
	git clone https://github.com/$YOURLOGIN/pixano-elements.git
	# go to code
	cd pixano-elements
```
3. Add the original repository as a remote called upstream
```bash
	git remote add upstream git@github.com:pixano/pixano-elements.git
	# OR
	git remote add upstream https://github.com/pixano/pixano-elements.git
```

#### First run
4. Install dependencies and build the project
```bash
cd pixano-elements
npm run deps
npm run build
```

5. Run the demo locally:

```bash
npx serve demo
```


### Modify and test the code

1. Check that you are on the right branch and pull upstream changes into your local repository if necessary
```bash
	git checkout master
	git pull upstream master
```
2. Create a new branch to work on
```bash
	git checkout -b $MY_BRANCH_NAME
```
3. Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.

4. Test your modifications locally using the serverless-demo
```bash
	npm run build
	npx serve demo
```
*This demo takes your local modifications into account, thanks to a bootstrap step.*


If you modified the dependencies, you better clean the project before rebuilding:

```bash
	npm run clearall
	npm run deps
	npm run build
	npx serve demo
```

### Create a pull request

5. Add or change the documentation as needed.
6. Commit your modifications using meaningfull comments.
7. Push your branch to your fork
```bash
	git push origin $MY_BRANCH_NAME
```
8. On github, open a pull request from your fork in the correct branch.

	*A green button "Compare & pull request" should appear. If not, click on branches button (https://github.com/$YOURLOGIN/pixano-elements/branches) and then click the "New pull request" button corresponding to your contribution branch.*

9. Complete the merge request message with a meaningfull title and a comprehensive comment : describe how your work is changing Pixano and what modules are impacted.
10. click on "Create pull request" => automatic verifications are made by github

Nice work ! Thank you for contributing to Pixano !
